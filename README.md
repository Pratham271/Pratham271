## Hello, I'm Pratham Chauhan! 👋 ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Pratham271)


As a Full-Stack Developer with a knack for AI integration, I'm all about crafting code that's as smooth as jazz and sharp as a katana. Constantly seeking out the latest tech trends is my jam—I'm basically a human API for innovation.

When I'm not slinging code, you'll find me cruising down new roads, both in my code and on the asphalt, exploring fresh beats, and getting lost in the rhythm of travel. Life's too short for boring code and predictable playlists, right?
